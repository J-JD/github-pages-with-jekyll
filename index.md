## Term of the day

### Source code

<blockquote>
Every computer program is written in a programming language, such as <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/java">Java</a>, <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/cplusplus">C/C+</a>, or <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/perl">Perl</a>. These programs include anywhere from a few lines to millions of lines of text, called source code.
</br>
</br>
Source code, often referred to as simply the <em>"source"</em> of a program, contains variable declarations, instructions, functions, loops, and other statements that tell the program how to function. Programmers may also add comments to their source code that explains sections of the code. These comments help others programmers gain at least some idea of what the source code does whithout requiring hours to dephicer it. Comments can be helpful to the original programmer as well if many months or years have gone by since the code was written.
</br>
</br>
Short programms called <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/script">scripts</a> can be run directly from the source code using a scripting engine, such as a VBScript or <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/php">PHP</a> engine. Most large programms, however, require that the source code first be compiled, which translate the code into a language the computer can understand. When changes are made to the source code of these programs, they must be recomplied in order for the changes to take effect in the program.
</br>
</br>
Small programs may use only one source code file, while larger programs may reference hundreds or even thousand of files. Having multiple source files helps organize the program into different sections. Having one file that contains every variable and function can make it difficult to locate specific sections of the code. Regarless of how many source code files are used to create a program, you will most likely not see any of the original files in your computer. This is because they are all combined into one program file, or <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/application">application</a>, when they are compiled.
